#### Data

ArXiv dataset: [Download](#)  
PubMed dataset: [Download](#)

The datasets are rather large. You need about 8G disk space to download and about 30G additional space when extracting the files. Each `tar` file consists of 4 files. `train.txt`, `val.txt`, `test.txt` respectively correspond to the training, validation, and test sets. These files are text files where each line is a json object corresponding to one scientific paper from ArXiv or PubMed. The `vocab` file is a plaintext file for the vocabulary.
